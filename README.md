# WHAT

First attempts at bgx. Coincidentally also first serious attempts at C++.

## Why
 In order for me to find, and learn, a somewhat approachable rendering library
 for use in personal projects and hobby (read: 'noob') simulations. Hopefully also going to try getting to grips with pointers along the way.

## Goals
* Learn basics of rendering. 
* Learn bgfx itself
* Become comfortable-ish with C++ syntax
* Getting properly into pointers
* Apply to some simple simulations
* Apply to some simple procedural algorithms (m. cubes? raymarch?)
